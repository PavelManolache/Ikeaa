## Technologies Used 
- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend of the application
- **Thymeleaf**: For rendering dynamic web pages on the server side
- **MySQL**: As the database to store product and user information 
- **Spring Data JDBC**: For database access and manipulation
- **Spring Web**: For building RESTful web services
- **Spring Boot Web Tools**: For development and testing
## Warning 
You need setup a MySQL database , in my case it's strumenti_db , so i recommend to just create a local database with the same name.
